# Google AdSense Setup Guide for Bali Report

## üìã Overview

This guide explains how to properly set up Google AdSense for the Bali Report website.

## üîë What You Need from AdSense Dashboard

When setting up AdSense, you'll be asked for different verification methods. Here's what to choose:

### 1. **Meta Tag** (Choose this for initial verification)
- ‚úÖ **USE THIS FIRST** for site ownership verification
- Already implemented in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- AdSense will provide something like:
  ```html
  <meta name="google-adsense-account" content="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX">
  ```
- We automatically use your `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADSENSE_CLIENT` env variable

### 2. **ads.txt File** (Required after approval)
- ‚úÖ **REQUIRED** for monetization to work
- Already created at `public/ads.txt`
- Update it with your publisher ID after approval:
  ```
  google.com, pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
  ```
- This file will be accessible at: https://bali.report/ads.txt

### 3. **AdSense Code Snippet** (For displaying ads)
- ‚úÖ **USE AFTER APPROVAL** to display actual ads
- Components already created in `src/components/GoogleAdSense.tsx`
- Just need to add your ad unit IDs to environment variables

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup Process

### Phase 1: Initial Application (Before Approval)

1. **Go to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)**

2. **Sign up and add your site:**
   - URL: `https://bali.report`
   - Language: English
   - Country: Your country

3. **When asked for verification method:**
   - Choose **"HTML tag"** or **"Meta tag"**
   - Copy your publisher ID (looks like `ca-pub-1234567890123456`)

4. **Update your environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # In your .env.local file
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADSENSE_CLIENT=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```

5. **Deploy your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add AdSense verification"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Verify in AdSense:**
   - Click "Verify" in AdSense dashboard
   - Wait for approval (24 hours to 14 days)

### Phase 2: After Approval

1. **Create Ad Units in AdSense:**
   - Go to Ads ‚Üí By ad unit
   - Create these units:
     - **Leaderboard**: Display ads ‚Üí Horizontal banner
     - **Sidebar**: Display ads ‚Üí Square
     - **In-feed**: Native ads ‚Üí In-feed
     - **Responsive**: Display ads ‚Üí Responsive

2. **Get your ad unit IDs:**
   Each ad unit will have a `data-ad-slot` number like `1234567890`

3. **Update ads.txt file:**

   # Edit public/ads.txt
   # Replace pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with your actual publisher ID
   google.com, pub-1234567890123456, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
   ```

4. **Update environment variables with ad slots:**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADSENSE_CLIENT=ca-pub-1234567890123456
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADSENSE_LEADERBOARD_SLOT=1234567890
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADSENSE_SIDEBAR_SLOT=0987654321
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADSENSE_NATIVE_SLOT=1122334455
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADSENSE_RESPONSIVE_SLOT=5544332211
   ```

5. **Deploy to production:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add AdSense ad units"
   git push origin main
   ```
